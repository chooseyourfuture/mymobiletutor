										<p>Studying at any Finnish university is based on academic freedom. With freedom comes great responsibility of planning and progressing in your studies. Counselling is available, but teachers do not automatically monitor your progress. In case you need help, please reach out to the various information sources, peers, tutors or university personnel.</p>
										<p>Faculties have different periods and systems in study-related practices, which can vary even between departments. For this reason, it is wise to attend faculty information sessions, the first lecture of each course and be an active information seeker.</p>

										<p>The Student Union of the University of Turku <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en"><strong>TYY</strong></a> is one of the oldest student unions in Finland. Founded in 1922, TYY has been taking a stand for students for almost 100 years. There is a student union (ylioppilaskunta) in each Finnish university.</p>
										<p>TYY is a public corporation completely independent of the University of Turku. The role of TYY is to represent its members, to advance the position of students in society, and provide them with services ranging from consultations with lawyers to sports and parties.</p>
										<p>The membership of a student union is by law compulsory for all Finnish university students - and for those international students who are studying for a Finnish degree. It is possible for the exchange students to join the student union, too. See instructions for joining <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/student-union"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
										<p>The Student Union has over 100 sub-organizations (based on study subjects, interests, and hobbies), so everyone can find the right one for them! See the list of organizations <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/sub-organisations/list-sub-organisations"><strong>here</strong></a>. Events organized by TYY and different sub-organizations are available in <a href="events.html">Events</a>.</p>
										<p>Representatives of TYY are there to help you in case you want to <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/contact-information"><strong>contact them</strong></a> or pay a visit. TYY <a href="https://www.tyy.fi/en/activities/tyy-wings/international-wing"><strong>International Wing</strong></a> is specialized in helping foreign students in their needs.</p>
