											<p>Typical Finnish films are either melancholic stories about the darker side of life or light romantic comedies. The master of melancholic movies is Aki Kaurismäki, who was awarded the Grand Prix at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival for the film "The Man without a Past" (Mies vailla menneisyyttä). Other well-known Finnish filmmakers include Renny Harlin, Klaus Härö, Dome Karukoski, Aku Louhimies, Tiina Lymi and Aleksi Mäkelä.</p>
											<p>The Unknown Soldier (Tuntematon sotilas) is based on the novel by Väinö Linna (1954) and was re-directed in 2017 becoming the most expensive movie in Finland. The movie is an excellent way to get a glimbse of Finnish history and mentality as it describes the times of The Continuation War between Finland and Russia in 1941-1944.</p>
											<p>In Finland, there are many interesting film-related events, such as the <a href="https://msfilmfestival.fi/en/"><strong>Midnight Sun Film Festival</strong></a> held in a small village in Lapland where film directors around the world, up-and-coming talents, the international audience, and the inhabitants of Sodankylä meet.</p>
											<p>The annual short film competition <a href="https://uneton48.com/en/docs/"><strong> Uneton48</strong></a> is the Finnish equivalent to the international competition The 48 Film Project.</p>

											<p>The Finnish national epic <a href="https://finland.fi/arts-culture/kalevala-the-finnish-national-epic/"><strong>Kalevala</strong></a> has gained worldwide reputation.
